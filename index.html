  <div class="entry-content"><p>This tutorial helps you to learn how to write Sql Statements let me start with :</p>

<p>To Create your DataBase just you need to make it in one line:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE DATABASE database_name
</code></pre>

<p>Now when you need to create new Table on your Data Base you have to execute:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE table_name(
  column_name1 data_type,
  column_name2 data_type,
  column_name3 data_type,
  ...
 )
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>The data type can be: Text, Byte, Integer, Double,Date,Char,Varchar(long),DateTime&hellip;..</li>
<li>They are 5 Types of Constraint

<blockquote><ul>
<li>NOT NULL</li>
<li>UNIQUE</li>
<li>CHECK</li>
<li>PRIMARY KEY</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>  <col1> Type Data Primary Key</p></li>
</ul>


<blockquote><ul>
<li>FOREIGN KEY</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>CONSTRAINT  &lt;fk table column&gt; FOREIGN KEY (col1, col2, ... coln)  REFERENCES&lt;extended table&gt; (col1, col2, ...  coln)
</code></pre>

<p>OR</p>

<pre><code>&lt;col1&gt;CONSTRAINT &lt;fk table column&gt; REFERENCES &lt;extended Table&gt;(col)  
</code></pre>

<p>To make some modification on Table exist on your Data Base</p>

<pre><code>ALTER TABLE table_name ADD column_name datatype
</code></pre>

<p>OR</p>

<pre><code>ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Add: to add a column</li>
<li>Modify: apply some modification on column exist</li>
<li>Drop: Drop column</li>
<li>Add Constraint: to add a constraint to a Column</li>
<li>Drop Constraint: to delete constraint</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It is supposed to post my Blog post before 1 months, But when you are studying in engineering class you can&rsquo;t find free time to write.
In this Post I am telling you about my experience in a Mozilla Work Week:</p>

<p>Me and Ahmed Nefzaoui, were invited to participate to this amazing work week, It was a huge opportunity for us to ,  At first we  were stressed  about getting our USA Visa, and then when we got it, the adventure travelling to USA and meet the most important people of Mozilla started.</p>

<p>It was from 1st December to 6th, which was gathering the different teams and people from different functional areas working for the Mozilla project, to plan for the future of Mozilla, specifically for the next year but also have a lot of FUN.
I was invited by the CBT (Community Building Team), because of the kind of my contribution, I was also around Localization, Webmaker and Firefox OS teams, I presented in many sessions in which discussed about Mozilla Events in 2015 and about the regional community propose solutions to the current problems. Amazing experience it was.
I&rsquo;m very proud to be there and meet all those awesome people I always knew through IRC, Twitter and Facebook. I had a chance to meet Pascal Chevrel  and talked  with him about Arabic Localization and I had the chance to get guidance from him on how to work on the l10n of mozilla.org.</p>

<p>I met also the Firefox OS UX Team led by Stephany Wilkes to discuss Design Patterns in Firefox OS Right-To-Left (RTL) User interface I was very happy to meet them and I spoke spontaneously to them, just because I felt like with my family.
I was very proud and glad to finally meet the lovely french women that I knew through IRC and Twitter and the first person to guide me in Womoz &ldquo;Dephine&rdquo;.
&ldquo; I&rsquo;m very glad to meet you delphine, I spent amazing moments with you in #mozlandia &rdquo;
I had the opportunity to meet and know new Mozillians, Thanks for all the people that made my travel and this experience happen  with a lot of Fun.
Really Thanks to Marcia, Delphine, Ioana, Ankit, Pascal, Alexandre :D I hope to meet you all very soon!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Mozilla Festival happened in London, It was an awesome Festival, it gathered passionate technology makers and creators eager to share their skills and many of them coming from different countries.</p>

<h1>Mozilla Festival 2014</h1>

<p>I was invited to this festival as a Festival facilitator with the other reps, firstly I want to thanks Mozilla and all the Reps for this opportunity.</p>

<p>I arrived on 23th October at 4:20pm exactly and it was too difficult to get to the Hotel. When I arrived to the Mozilla Office, I began with introducing my self and my contributions as a Rep. So the meeting was about the schedule of our participation to Mozilla Festival and we shared some gifts from our countries and some goodies. It was a funny first day with Reps.</p>

<p>The First Day of Mozilla Festival was on 24th October. We met all the other volunteers of the Mozilla Festival and we planned for our sessions. First in this day I worked with Deb (is an amazing reps from India), we worked on <a href="http://mermi.github.io/MozFest/#/">Mozilla Reps&#8217; presentation slides for the science fair booth</a>. I am very glad to work with you, deb</p>

<p><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1fiOYDgXa9U/VEu6kLnVhUI/AAAAAAAACmg/palWVEA8KB8/s1600/IMG_20141024_200227205.jpg" title="collaborative work" alt="collaboration work" /></p>

<p>And I presented the Popcorn Maker with Ankit (who is also another reps from India and Webmaker Mentor), it was really amazing all the people coming andasking us about the tools: how does it work? how how can I use it ? and for what I will need it and sometimes we talked about the Webmaker Project.</p>

<p>On 25th October was the first Big day, I joined the keynote in the morning and after that I have joined the session of Mozilla Student Ambassador Recruitment it was a funny session. Also I had a talk with the Hive Community and they asked me if I want to make a local community in Tunisia and it was grateful opportunity for me so we shared our contact after a long talk and I am so motivated to make local hive community in Tunisia. In the afternoon I joined the Maker Party booth, all the stands are amazing there, they are many kids child teenager old people adult it was AMAZING and I helped on the popocorn Maker booths and I had talked again to people about PopCorn Maker and show them how to use it and what is the goal of Popcorn Maker.</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B0zYSvZIUAA6B9H.jpg:large" title="explain the needed of popcorn maker" alt="explain the needed of popcorn maker" /></p>

<p>After a long day we had a dance party with karaoke it was so funny we have a hindi dance and I have joined the indian guys on the stage.</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B01J7jgIIAEVoNJ.jpg:large" title="lungui dance party" alt="dancing lungui dance" /></p>

<p>The last day of Mozilla Festival was the most tiring and amazing day, I came too early to the Venue with other Reps to get our Flame and I spent all the day flashing the flame given to the attendees and explain more how to use it and how to Flash it for the people who asked for the engineering build.</p>

<p><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3934/15448655490_4dd029c362_h.jpg" title="flash booth" alt="flashbooth" /></p>

<p>It was a very exhausting and crazy experience for me. I really had fun, know a lot of things and discovered a lot of things. Also I have met the craziest and most beautiful people in this world :D</p>
